1. Quantum-Resistant Encryption (ML-KEM)
What: Files encrypted with post-quantum algorithms that future quantum computers can't break.
How it works:

User uploads file â†’ Encrypted with AES-256 (fast)
AES key wrapped with ML-KEM-768 (quantum-safe)
Only passphrase holder can decrypt

Why it matters: Data stays secure even 10 years from now when quantum computers exist.
